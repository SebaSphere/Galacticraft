# Galacticraft
This branch of the Galacticraft repo is being refactored out to use [architectury
](https://github.com/architectury), allowing Galacticraft to be compiled for both Fabric and Forge.

## Notice
This branch is **NOT** in a playable state, no jars will be provided, if you want to play using this branch you will
need to compile it yourself.

## Development Guidelines
Follow the guidelines provided by [architectury](https://github.com/architectury).

TLDR: all assets and non-loader specific code goes in `:common`, DO NOT, for the love of god, update gradle past `5.5.1`.
